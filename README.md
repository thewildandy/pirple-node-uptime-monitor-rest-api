# Uptime Monitor REST API

The REST API component of a series of projects created as part of the course material of the Node.js Masterclass published by Pirple.

The course centers around creating a reasonably complex and full-featured uptime monitoring solution using only raw Node.js and its native APIs.

**You won't see a package.json here, since no third party libraries were used.**

The overall solution spans three distinct projects:
- REST API (you are here)
- Web GUI
- CLI

I will add links to the latter two as they progress.
